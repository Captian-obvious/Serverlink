<h1>Serverlink</h1>
<h3>An ssh client with a visual twist!</h3>
<p>Serverlink is an ssh client with a visual twist, 
letting you use a gui instead of text commands to control a server.
Developed and maintained by CaptianObvious, this aims to make using an ssh client easy to understand!<br>
*To use this properly you will need knowledge of bash</p>
<h3>Main features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Visual interface (still WIP) for controlling connections and configurations</li>
    <li>VisualShell (TM)</li>
    <li>Command line utilities for basic management</li>
    <li>Mounting of the your home folder on the server</li>
    <li>SSH abstractions for ease of use</li>
</ul>

<em>This program mostly is only supported well on linux, a windows build does exist but dont treat it as reliable.</em><br>
*note: this is still in development and a WIP
