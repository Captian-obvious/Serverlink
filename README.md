<h1>Serverlink</h1>
<h3>An ssh client with a visual twist!</h3>
<p>Serverlink is an ssh client with a visual twist, 
letting you use a gui instead of text commands to control a server.
Developed and maintained by CaptianObvious, this aims to make using an ssh client easy to understand!</p>
*note: this is still in development and a WIP
